We’re going to be holding a cosplay contest on the main stage in the upcoming School Festival!

(This contest will be open to UMAnime members only, and you must sign a form!
University rules apply, and make sure your cosplay has nothing that resembles a weapon!)

Enjoy the Festival dressed up as your favourite characters!
We can’t wait to see your cosplays!
